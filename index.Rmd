### Abstract

Our main question is, how does the amount of social media usage affect the user's mental health? This question is important because with the recent rise of social media users increasing, and the age of users becoming younger, having bad mental health at a younger age can hinder their growth in a bad way. We decided to touch on this topic since social media usage has increased over the years, and we believe it will only keep on increasing, leading to more people with mental health issues, and people with these mental health issues getting younger.

### Keywords

Social media, mental health, age, gender, interation.

### Introduction  

In the digital age, social media has become a central part of everyday life for millions of people around the world. While it offers unprecedented opportunities for communication and information sharing, there is growing concern about its impact on mental health. Our project aims to analyze user behavior on social media platforms and assess its correlation with various mental health outcomes. By leveraging data from surveys and digital usage metrics, we intend to create an interactive web application that visualizes these relationships and provides insights into how digital habits influence mental well-being. Some research question we have are; 

How does the amount of time spent on social media correlate with reported levels of anxiety and depression among different age groups? We believe this is important since this question addresses public health concerns and can inform policy decisions regarding digital literacy and mental health support systems. It motivates us since with rising screen time, understanding its impact on mental health can help in developing guidelines for healthier social media consumption.

What are the effects of social media interactions (likes, shares, comments) on the self-esteem of individuals? It motivates us since these datas are difficult to see, and social validation is a significant aspect of social media usage; studying its effects on self-esteem can illuminate psychological impacts that may not be immediately apparent. And it's important, since Insights from this analysis can aid mental health professionals in creating interventions that help users maintain healthy relationships with digital platforms.

Does the nature of content consumed (positive vs. negative news) on social media affect the user’s mood and mental health status? This question is important since it's one of the direct contents that can affect the mental health directly, and exposure to different types of content could have varying impacts on mood, which in turn affects overall mental health.

Are there significant differences in mental health impacts between various social media platforms?
Our motivation to this is because different platforms have different user experiences and content types, which might influence mental health differently. And it's important to ask this question since this question can guide users in choosing their digital environments more wisely and encourage platforms to modify features that may negatively affect mental health.
